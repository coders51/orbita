# Introduction

# Orbita
This repository will be used to contain everything that needs to be shared between all the services/repositories, in particular

* This repository's wiki will hold the documentation about: API, domain concepts, shared data, etc...
* Setup process and project automation scripts
* Integration and smoke tests

This projects is based on microservices and exchange [domain events](DomainEvents) on a [event bus](EventBus).

The actual services are:

* OAuth service - The repository is [here](https://git.coders51.com/coders51/orbita-oauth/tree/master). It's **_write a little description here_**.
* Networking service - The repository is [here](https://git.coders51.com/coders51/orbita-networking/tree/master). This service maps the relationships between users and other entities. It responds to events like `"FriendshipRequested"` and similar events that may involve creating of, updating of and querying by relationships. In the case of a `"FriendshipRequested"` event, a `FriendRequest` between two users is saved in its data store. Later on, this `friend_request` may be accepted when this service receives `"FriendshipAccepted"` event that involves the same two users. By default, this runs in `localhost:4001` in development.
* Notification service - The repository is [here](https://git.coders51.com/coders51/orbita-notification/tree/master). It's **_write a little description here_**.

# Dev Machine Setup

1. Install Ansible and Vagrant
2. Go this repo's root directory
3. `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` try `sudo` if the command file with permission error.
4. `vagrant up` - This will take a long time as it will provision your vagrant machine with all the dependencies of Orbita's services.
5. `vagrant ssh` - Logs into your Orbita dev machine
6. Run `./setup.sh` to initialize all the repositories (`orbita-networking`, `orbita-notifications`, and so on)
7. `foreman start` - Start all services

* Note that all the Orbita repositories must exist in your computer. They need to be located in the same directory as this Orbita repo.
* Make sure that the forwarded ports found in the Vagrantfile are open in your host computer. `vagrant up` will fail if those ports aren't available.
* If you want to start services separately, refer to the Vagrantfile to see how to start them.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
